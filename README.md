# BLOOM01

Goals -attemped to setup Project in Github with To Do List

  Run stepper in stealthchop/spreadcycle/stallguard/coolstep modes
  Recognize and set petal open/close positions using physical stoppers and sensorless homing as initial sequence (setup)
  Set operating range inside these positions with buffer
  Run simple open/close or noise function variations within the range

Stretch
  Run 3+ steppers simultaneously using multiplexer or master/slave configuration using I2C or other protocols
  Synchronize 3 steppers or use noise function variations in synchronization

Ultimate
  Robust software architecture to control and choreograph large arrangement of steppers with those features
  Incorporate sensor feedback (motion sensing, camera, light, or otherwise)
